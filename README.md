# The Legend of Timaeus
### Short FPS Medieval Game (Unity 3D)

<br>

The story takes place in a small village called Alexandria.

The hero, Timaeus, wakes up just outside the village without having any memories about how he got there.

He meets a young lady named Eliza, who takes him on a tour around the village and introduces him to other villagers.

During the tour, Timaeus learns about the tragedy that hit the village, due to the appearance of the Forest Orcs.

Timaeus is called to confront those orcs in order to save Alexandria. But first he must complete a couple of Quests
in order to acquire some essential items for his journey: A sword and some health potions.

After that, he needs to train in order to increase his level, by fighting some orcs near the village.

*Note: This is a Demo version created in the context of my University project. The story is completed upon reaching Level 5, after all 3 Quests are cleared.*
